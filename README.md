### What is this repository for? ###

Mercurius is a microservices-based platform designed to offer flexible and scalable solutions for modern applications. This project integrates multiple microservices to deliver seamless functionality, efficient communication, and robust security. It is ideal for building dynamic, scalable, and modular applications in a cloud environment.

### Key Features ###
### Authentication Service ###:

User registration, login, and session management with integrated social login options for convenience.
This service issues access tokens to authorize secure interactions with other microservices.

### API Gateway/Edge Server ###:

A single entry point for all incoming requests, responsible for initial validation and routing to the appropriate microservices.

### Service Interaction ### :

Handles various business logic tasks such as product offerings, account management, and eligibility checks.


### BaseProduct Service ###: 

Manages all services related to new users and ensures seamless integration with other components.

### Bundled Product Service ###:

Deals with products and offers, determining the best options for each user and collaborating with the Eligibility Service.

### Message Microservice ###: 

Sends alerts and notifications to users about various events or offers through Kafka event broker.

### Eligibility Service ###: 

Updates user information with offers and eligibility status. It communicates with other services to ensure consistent data flow.

### Eureka Server ###: 

Acts as a service discovery and load balancing component, ensuring reliable connections between microservices.
### Database Layer ###: 

Supports the microservices architecture with local data storage and retrieval.
Infrastructure
Mercurius runs in a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring scalability, high availability, and ease of deployment. It uses Feign Client for synchronous communication between services and Kafka for asynchronous event-driven communication.

### Monitoring and Observability ###:
To maintain reliability and performance, Mercurius incorporates monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana, as well as centralized logging with ELK stack. Distributed tracing is implemented to track the flow of requests across services, aiding in debugging and optimization.

### Security and Compliance ###:
Mercurius adheres to modern security best practices, ensuring proper authentication, authorization, and data encryption. Compliance with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA is considered where applicable.

### Getting Started ###
To set up and run Mercurius, follow the detailed installation and deployment instructions in the repository's documentation. 


### How do I get set up? ###

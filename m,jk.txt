Good Afternoon Sir,

As a quick follow-up:

As I mentioned earlier, I have completed my project in microservices. Under the guidance of Sambit Joshi, I am now going to learn the following:

Reactive Java
JUnit, Mockito
Design Patterns: SOLID, Singleton, Factory, Cache, Strategy, MVC, DAO
Error Handling in Microservices
AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)
I will also be updating my project accordingly.
